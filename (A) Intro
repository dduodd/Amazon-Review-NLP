# Amazon Review

  This is an NLP project. Goal is simple: to create a ML model that can read reviews so that it can analysis and compile the results in one place 
(aka. recreate the star rating system, except, ML gives the stars based on the review text). And my group and I managed to acheive a result of 89.04% accuracy. 
Unfortunally, some of the code will take a LONG ASS TIME to run.

        1) My partner and I used the appliance category
        2) you need both, the data and metadata
